Whenever we're making changes always follow the rules outlining whichever section we're making changes in.
Frontend changes follow the [frontend_rules.md](mdc:frontend/frontend_rules.md)
Backend changes follow the [backend_rules.md](mdc:backend/backend_rules.md)
If there is a route mismatch between frontend and backend always try to make the frontend match the route expected by back end, NOT the other way around.
