# Components

Components are reusable UI elements used across the application. They:

- Provide specific functionality that can be used in multiple views
- Are self-contained and handle their own logic
- Should be designed for reusability

## Structure

Each component follows this pattern:
- `ComponentName/ComponentNameComponent.js` - Component logic
- `ComponentName/ComponentNameComponent.jsx` - Component presentation
- `ComponentName/ComponentNameComponent.css` - Component styles
- `ComponentName/index.js` - Export file
